# SASS-WEBSITE

This repository contains the source code for a website built using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). SASS is a powerful CSS preprocessor that allows you to write cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abokmadaki/sass-website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd sass-website
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server and watch for changes, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will compile the SASS files into CSS and launch a local development server. Any changes you make to the SASS files will be automatically compiled and reflected in the browser.

### Build

To build the final production-ready version of the website, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will compile and optimize the SASS files, generate CSS, and bundle all the necessary assets. The compiled files will be placed in the `dist` directory.

### Folder Structure

The main folders and files in this project are structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code files.
  - `styles/`: Contains SASS files.
  - `scripts/`: Contains JavaScript files.
  - `images/`: Contains image assets.
- `dist/`: Contains the compiled and optimized files for production.

### Customization

Feel free to customize the website by modifying the SASS files located in the `src/styles` directory. You can also add or remove JavaScript files as needed in the `src/scripts` directory.
